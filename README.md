# SimpleQuiz_App

In this project, a Quiz application has been developed with the help of Android Studio using Kotlin as the programming language. This application aims to test the general knowledge of the user and promote general awareness among the masses. This project allows users to test themselves through their mobile only with a simple and attractive user interface(UI).

👉🏻 Procedure
1. On the welcome screen, register the user by entering the name.
